ðŸ“„ Week 1: Dataset Setup and Exploration

In the first week of the project, we focused on preparing and understanding the E-Waste image dataset. The key tasks completed this week included:

âœ… Data Acquisition: Uploaded the E-Waste image dataset to the Colab environment.

âœ… Data Loading: Used image_dataset_from_directory to easily load the images into training and validation datasets with proper resizing and batching.

âœ… Exploration:

Displayed the class names to understand the categories present in the dataset.

Visualized a sample of training images to check image quality, structure, and labeling.


âœ… Directory Organization: Confirmed the expected folder structure (train/, val/, test/) so that TensorFlow could correctly infer classes.


By the end of this week, we successfully:

Understood the dataset's classes and contents.

Verified that all images load and display properly.

Established the data pipeline that will be used in subsequent model training.


This lays a strong foundation for the next phase â€” model building and training â€” which we will implement in the coming week.
